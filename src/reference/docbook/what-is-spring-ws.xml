    <title>What is Spring Web Services?</title>
    <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>
            Spring Web Services (Spring-WS) is a product of the Spring community focused on creating document-driven 
            Web services.
            Spring Web Services aims to facilitate contract-first SOAP service development, allowing for the creation of
            flexible web services using one of the many ways to manipulate XML payloads.
            The product is based on Spring itself, which means you can use the Spring concepts such as dependency 
            injection as an integral part of your Web service.

            People use Spring-WS for many reasons, but most are drawn to it after finding alternative SOAP stacks 
            lacking when it comes to following Web service best practices.
            Spring-WS makes the best practice an easy practice. This includes practices such as the WS-I basic profile,
            Contract-First development, and having a loose coupling between contract and implementation.
            The other key features of Spring Web services are:

            <title>Powerful mappings</title>
            <para>
                You can distribute incoming XML requests to any object, depending on message payload, SOAP Action header, 
                or an XPath expression.

            <title>XML API support</title>
            <para>
                Incoming XML messages can be handled not only with standard JAXP APIs such as DOM, SAX, and StAX, but also JDOM, 
                dom4j, XOM, or even marshalling technologies.

            <title>Flexible XML Marshalling</title>
            <para>
                Spring Web Services builds on the Object/XML Mapping module in the Spring Framework, which supports JAXB 1 and 2, Castor,
                XMLBeans, JiBX, and XStream.

            <para>
                Spring-WS uses Spring application contexts for all configuration, which should help Spring developers 
                get up-to-speed nice and quickly. Also, the architecture of Spring-WS resembles that of Spring-MVC.

            <para>
                WS-Security allows you to sign SOAP messages, encrypt and decrypt them, or authenticate against them.

            <title>Integrates with Spring Security</title>
            <para>
                The WS-Security implementation of Spring Web Services provides integration with Spring Security.
                This means you can use your existing Spring Security configuration for your SOAP service as well.

        <title>Runtime environment</title>
        <para>
            Spring Web Services requires a standard Java 1.6 Runtime Environment. Java 1.7 and 1.8 are also supported.
            Spring-WS also requires Spring 3.2 or higher.
        </para>
        <para>
            Spring-WS consists of a number of modules, which are described in the remainder of this section.

            <para>
                The XML module (<filename>spring-xml.jar</filename>) contains various XML support classes for Spring Web 
                Services. This module is mainly intended for the Spring-WS framework itself, and not a Web service 
                developers.

                    The Core module (<filename>spring-ws-core.jar</filename>) is the central part of the Spring's
                    Web services functionality.
                    It provides the central <link linkend="web-service-messages">

                    <classname>SoapMessage</classname></link> interfaces, the <link linkend="server">server-side</link> 
                    framework, with powerful message dispatching, and the various support classes for implementing Web
                    service endpoints; and the <link linkend="client">client-side</link>

                    provides a WS-Security implementation that integrates
                    with the core Web service package. It allows you to add principal tokens, sign, and decrypt and encrypt SOAP
                    messages. Additionally, it allows you to leverage your existing Spring Security security implementation for
                    authentication and authorization.
